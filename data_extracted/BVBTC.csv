Approximately every 10 minutes, 6.25 new bitcoin enter circulation. That’s only about 900 new bitcoin per day.

On approximately May 9th, 2024 that halves to 3.125 new bitcoin every ~10mins or 450 new bitcoin per day.

Stack accordingly.

Inflation is NOT transitory.

“Interoperability”

Fancy words for removing friction where friction need not exist in the first place.

Creativity is what happens when you stop judging your thoughts. Art is what happens when you bridge the gap between your thoughts and your medium. Mastery is what happens when you judge your creation at a technical level and use that judgement to improve your technique.

Elon should sell. The same energy usage he’s misunderstanding is being used to secure the bitcoins in his treasury too. I’ll gladly buy them and watch as my personal treasury outperforms his while supporting human rights and the end of the petrodollar. Fuck you Elon.

Elon is such an egotistical shit. 

Was this motivated by pressure from the government and Tesla's government contracts? Pressure from shareholders? Environmental SJW's who don't understand #Bitcoin?

So annoying.

Did you sell all your shitcoins?

Stack sats and hodl
Beware “Get rich quick!”

Saw someone tweet “WHO IS SELLING?” so naturally I checked price.

And you know what?

I’m unaffected.

Every day I get more sats.

That’s all that matters.

I don’t care what price I get them at, because I’m converting dirty fiat to pristine #BTC.

Art is different things to different people. When I look at someone’s art, I see the artist, a period of their life, a time filled with emotion, happiness, sadness, hopefully passion... art is ledger entry in the life of an artist, their proof of work. Or at least it should be.

Ownership is control.

a UTXO is “mine” because I control the keys that allow me to spend the BTC. No one else can spend my UTXO.

when you own the keys to an NFT though... does that prevent others from consuming the associated artwork or other media? No

So what do you own?

Let’s combine HFSP Twitter threads with fractions. This will increase the supply of bit coins right?  I’ll start us off with the numerator “1” and the denominator “H” and by the time we get to “14 / R” there will be more bit coins. If that doesn’t work I’ll order a pizza.

There are no queens or kings
No presidents nor ministers

Find a loose thread in your mind and tug on that thread, only no matter how much you tug, there is no end to it.

It’s weird how desensitized I’ve become to violence in the news. 

I don’t like it at all. One minute my heart goes out to those who are suffering and the next I’m distracted by a meme. I guess it’s a coping mechanism otherwise I wouldn’t be able to function.

It’s better to rebrand from “Crypto” to “Bitcoin” before the Bitcoin bull market really gets going. Not during.

I‘ll admit “Yield farming” is a great meme. Similar to “sat stacking/ stacking sats.” It’s well conceived.

It also makes me think of the chapter in Sapiens about agriculture and the meaning of “Domestication.”

And I wonder if people are using DeFi or if DeFi is using people.

@BitDevsLA

Covid is going to have a negative impact on most of the world, but I'm bullish AF on VR right now.

The “American Dream” of owning a home with a white picket fence etc etc is, at its core, simply a desire for security, for a wealth-building asset, one that will appreciate in value and can be used to accumulate even more wealth.

#Bitcoin is that asset and more.

The US Dollar and every other failing fiat currency exist because governments say so, and people use them because until now they had to.

Bitcoin exists because countless individuals want it to, and use it because they choose to.

Think about that.

Bitcoin is still but a child. 

Thus far it’s shown precociousness, stubbornness and a rebelliousness that shows no sign of lessening.

Now, as Bitcoin enters a new decade, it will get stronger and taller and smarter; it will continue to rebel.

It will continue to be Bitcoin.

Just landed in the US after an amazing first trip to Japan. Really looking forward to going back.

From the sightseeing, to the food and hospitality, to the fact that I didn’t see a single “BCASH ACCEPTED HERE” sign... truly an amazing country.

1/ Here’s to the fallen
Those who’ve lost faith
Who suckle on the teet 
Of an evil Ringwraith
There’s yeezy & marsh 
& of course Kevin Pham
They’re a pack of greedy wolves
So be not, a lamb
Some sold their accounts
Others just their soul
Bitcoin’s forgotten
Lost sight of the goal

One little pump, 
And they spin it that way,
But Bitcoin keeps churning out, 
Block after block,

Many factions exist in Bitcoin/Crypto twitter but there’s one that’s most dangerous imo. And it doesn’t have a name. It’s just those folks who are grumpy, mean and always have an axe to grind. 

They wallow in and spread their misery. Many can’t even help it.

Don’t let em win.

How do we spread ₿itcoin adoption?

@trylolli
 is currently my favorite way because consumers don't have to buy BTC directly.

Are there any other companies with similar onboarding techniques?

Every day I look around and think to myself..

These poor schmucks have no idea about the future that’s coming.

And wherever I go.. I try to tell people about Bitcoin in a natural, organic way.

And you should too.

Talk to one person about Bitcoin today. 

That’s all it takes.

Bitcoin doesn’t need a football team, or a carefully timed token burn, or any other sort of shenanigans to be successful.

Bitcoin has 10+ years of grassroots marketing that cannot be replicated.

Bitcoin is permissionless in many ways.

For instance, I don’t need anyone’s permission to be whatever kind of Bitcoiner I decide to be. 

Neither do you.

Want to be closed minded, rude, & impatient? Go for it.

Want to be kind, understanding, & patient? 

..Even better.

The beauty of Crypto Twitter is that it allows all of us to connect.

Bitcoiner or not, most of us believe that fiat is a sinking ship, and it doesn’t matter if you live in a crypto hub like SF or in Okie Skokie.

CT is our community.

It’s a reminder that we are not alone.

Pro Tip: 

If hungry and heading home, pickup a double double & animal style fries from In-n-Out.

Oven burger & fries at 350. Take burger out after 5 minutes and fries after 10.

You’ll have a  burger, a not too crispy bun, carmelized cheese & onions on perfectly crispy fries.

Idea: 

An airline, but there is no checked baggage at all. Instead there’s a giant overhead bin that can fit large suitcases.

Planes leave sooner and turn around sooner. If you can’t lift your bag into the bin you can’t bring it. 

Everyone wins except for baggage handlers.

If you want your hand held by an abusive parent who steals your lunch money then keep saving $USD.

Otherwise educate yourself, #BuyBitcoin, and learn how to #HODL.

So I’ve been wanting to get into mining for a long time now. 

I’ve bothered 
@cryptochrisw
 at least 5 times to say I was “finally” going to build a rig.

Well this time I mean it!

Today is build day, and I’m tackling 3 rigs. 2 570 rigs and 1 2070 rig. 

Let’s do this.

I don’t like to make fun of no coiners or “future coiners” as I like to call them..

But I secretly LÖL at anyone who can’t see that money, like everything, has to evolve, and that crypto is the likeliest next step towards that inevitability.

It makes me happy to meet those people. Ofc I wish I was one of them. I wish that I had “gotten in earlier” too.

But more importantly I recognize that my time in crypto- OUR time, is Now.

I got excited for a minute and then I went on this thing called the Internet to see if it was true. 

It wasn’t. 

But.. I wasn’t upset.

Why?

Because in Crypto we don’t trust, we VERIFY.

Why am I bullish? Tonight a friend who used to shit on crypto finally asked me if he could send me money to invest for him. I told him I would help him open a 
@GeminiDotCom
 account and a 
@binance
