When computing the average of two numbers, yes, (a+b)/2 is the definition, but it's often a very suboptimal algorithm for *calculating* it in practice. Most of the time, you want a + (b-a)/2; numbers that get averaged tend to be close together so this requires less computation.

My economic model-in-one-tweet for crypto as a digital asset:

* Consider a security company that stores gold in vault, charges 0.2% / year; market cap = NPV of expected future profit
* Now, imagine the asset the company secures is *the company's own shares*

Things we learned in 2017: in the full-blocks equilibrium, transaction fee prices are even more volatile than cryptocurrency prices. This suggests that for costs incurred over time rather than immediately (eg. storage space), setting a fixed fee may actually be not that bad.
