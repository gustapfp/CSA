Freeing ourselves from Central Banks is one of the greatest filters. Only now, after the Riksbank established in 1668, is it possible.

How long this window remains open is uncertain. Perhaps a long time, perhaps not. 

In case it is the latter, we should act now.

On a serious note, trading with leverage in a super volatile market is hard.

The best and most consistently rewarding strategy is:
- Buy spot
- Hodl multi-year
- Benefit from big moves up
- Survive dips

This is why Hodlers enjoy dips, they stack more in their long-term play.
