In '17 bull run I would sell coins high to buy coins that were low - rookie mistake.

Often the high coins would then go on to make many more highs later, even if I did sell a local top.

Coins making highs are making highs for a reason.

It's difficult to hold during great volatility, try to focus on trading trends not pumps. 

This might mean sizing on and sizing off at different times, holding core positions. Zoom out & watch major trend - everyone has their personal invalidations, naked PA, MAs, S/R, etc.

Selling at local resistance to lock in profits is a tempting behavior that robs you of future profits and keeps you in the cycle of trying to taking more trades up and down. 

More trades = more mistakes = less profit / more loss

Get in a winning position and hold it

Over time:

- 90% of traders lose money
- crypto goes up more than it goes down

Therefore you can increase your chances of survival by trading long only. 

That doesn't mean long resistance, buy tops. It often means patience waiting for a set up, sometimes a very long time.
