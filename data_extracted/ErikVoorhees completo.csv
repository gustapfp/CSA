Don't let anyone tell you that #Bitcoin is ""fiat""

Fiat does not mean (though is often alleged to mean), ""not backed by anything physical.""

Fiat accurately means ""value by decree.""  

USD and EUR are fiat. 

BTC and gold are not fiat... their value comes purely from the market.

There seems to be some confusion on what ""legal tender"" means. 

It *does not* mean someone must receive payment in a specific form. 

It *does* mean someone must accept that form of payment to settle a debt, if the debtor prefers to pay in said form. 

Important difference.

Minimum wage proponents allege workers should be paid a ""dignified wage."" 

I would think it's far more dignified to earn $10/hr by your  own merit, than $15/hr because a politician forced someone to give it to you.

Min wage of $15 helps the worker who is worth $20 but was being paid $10. She now earns $15.

And it hurts the worker who is worth $10 and was being paid $5. She's now unemployed.

Under what ethical premise is it okay to harm the poorer of the two, to help the wealthier?

To advocate for crypto is to advocate for money to be subject to open competition, like any other important good or service in a market economy. The money monopolists (central banks and governments) will oppose this change, softly & curiously at first, and then with a vengeance.

M2 Money Supply of USD is ~$14 trillion. At 3% debasement rate (aka inflation), that means the loss of ~$420 billion PER YEAR in purchasing power. More accurately, the theft of this purchasing power from holders to printers (banks + gov). Greater than all other theft combined.
