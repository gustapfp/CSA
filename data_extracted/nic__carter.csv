the reason having pure monetary commodities (i.e. things that have no non-monetary use-case) is a good idea is because they are a sink for the storage of value that doesn't distort the market. if corn futs became a global money, corn would get expensive and people would starve.

So insurance companies now advertise that they won’t reprice your policy even if you demonstrate risky behavior (get in an accident). Is this a “weird consequence of ZIRP” thing or a “insurance biz model is more complex than I thought” thing?

- ones who held crypto and cant repay investors
