Don't ever tell family members or friends that you own Bitcoin. At most, only tell a SO, nobody else.

Being seen as the ""Bitcoin person"" will only bring you ridicule in bear markets, and people awkwardly asking you for favors or cash in bull markets.

Bitcoin bubbles need an ignition, usually a huge % gain in a very short period, this is then reported on and spreads virally, this then attracts new money and pushes the price even higher, a kind of positive feedback loop. The average person then starts FOMO-ing and panic buys.

We need a new term to describe assets like Libra, Ripple, EOS, Cardano, and similarly permissioned systems. The term “cryptocurrency” shouldn’t apply to these. Perhaps we can start calling them “Authocurrency”? Has a nice sound to it and makes clear they rely on an authority!

Bitcoin Cash probably is closer to the Bitcoin described in the whitepaper, but the whitepaper was written 10 years ago, and has major errors. Let Bitcoin move past the idea of low fees, and let Bitcoin Cash stay on Satoshi’s old ideas, and we see which succeeds. I hold both!

It's FUD to claim that miners won't support a PoW change, or will *always* be bankrupted by it. In theory, it's possible to have a subset of miners signal for support of a PoW change, and reward these miners in some way on the new chain. It's not necessarily a disaster for them.

Bitcoin is a failed experiment if 2X succeeds. True Bitcoiners will either fork away from 2X and change POW, or they’ll quit.

Whitepaper is outdated and incorrect, promotes flawed understanding of Bitcoin, responsible for a lot of the “longest chain is Bitcoin” FUD.

From my limited interaction with 2x supporters, they are weak minded and quick to “compromise”, no spine, defer to CEO leadership. Cucks.

Brand confusion that the 2x hard fork will cause isn’t worth the upgrade. Some services will only accept “true” Bitcoin, others accept B2X.

Assuming 2x succeeds, true Bitcoin will still live on. Will take some years for ecosystem to route around NYA companies and educate users.
