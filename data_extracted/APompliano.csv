One of the biggest mistakes I see young investors make is that they invest in certain markets because they think they’re supposed to, rather than because they’re interested in them.

You don’t have to invest in every market. Find what intrigues you & then become the best at that.

By the end of this year, Venezuela will have cut 14 zeroes off the end of their currency since 2008.

If they hadn't cut those 14 zeroes off, 1 bolivar today would instead be 100 trillion bolivar.

Literally 100,000,000,000,000 bolivar.

Every Venezuelan would be a trillionaire.

2. ""Generational wealth, that's the key""

3. ""'Til you own your own, you can't be free""

4. ""Men lie, women lie, but numbers don't""

Ohio’s unemployment claims are almost 140,000 from last Sunday till yesterday.

140,000 in 5 days. From one state.

This could get really bad very quickly.

My guess is over 1 million net new people will file unemployment claims this week.

May even eclipse 2 million by end of week. 

That would be approximately 15-30% increase in unemployment in a week.

Dear

You can’t change Bitcoin’s monetary policy, supply schedule, interest rate, or transaction history.

There is no CEO or employees. No one will answer customer service complaints.

But you can always count on Bitcoin. 

It never goes down.

Why ""market cap"" is bad signal in crypto:

- I could create a token
- Hold 1 trillion tokens for myself
- Sell 1 token for $1
- Token now has $1 trillion market cap
- And I have $999,999,999,999 of tokens

This is obviously absurd. Stop worrying about market cap.
