Is it necessarily a bad thing if a protocol optimizes a little bit for being theatrical?

(Thinking about Bitcoin's sudden halvings every 4 years, as opposed to the smooth exponential decay curve that a mathematician would have made)

I've always found the concept of ""the world's largest city"" not to be very pointful; it depends on the arbitrary classification of what legally constitutes a city. ""Points in the world with the most people within 50km"" seems like a much better statistic to track.

yes, well spotted - if you take a circle with 100km / 62 mile radius from the centre of these 4 cities, this is the population total estimate for each

- NYC: 21 million
- London: 20 million
- Tokyo: 42 million
- Dhaka: 57 million

Faster sync times, better light client guarantees, reduced (maybe 0) ""selfish mining"" risk, per-confirm reversion probability much lower in normal case (no attacks + good global network latency), better randomness, reduced losses if unexpected quantum breakthroughs appear.

Reminder: penalties for the early months of ETH2 have been reduced to 1/3 to 1/4 of their Medalla levels. And if 524,288 ETH participate, rewards are ~25% APR.

So in fact even if you somehow get slashed ~3 weeks after you join, staking would still probably be net-profitable.

The idea is that when looking at data/trends you should be careful to watch out for the possibility that you're missing some of the data because it has been outright eliminated.

0/ Uniswap only works because Ethereum is slow, *and* because Uniswap LP fees are expensive (30 bips)

Normally, when you combine two bad features, you get something extra bad

But in this case, negative * negative = (almost) positive

How can this be?

There are different kinds of governance problems. Sometimes, the thing being governed is *meant to be* agile, other times it's meant to be a quiet quasi-automaton, more like a court than a legislature. Eg. quadratic funding is more like the latter than the former.

...to revisit some of the fundamentals design principles that Ethereum 2.0 has been built on:

- Why PoS?
- Why Sharding?
- Why ETH Issuance?
- Why 1559?

What questions do you want asked?"

ETH2 scaling for data will be available *before* ETH2 scaling for general computation. This implies that rollups will be the dominant scaling paradigm for at least a couple of years: first ~2-3k TPS with eth1 as data layer, then ~100k TPS with eth2 (phase 1). Adjust accordingly.

But the roadmap has an interesting unintended artefact: sharded applications by themselves need phase 2. But sharded rollups only need phase 1, because rollups use the chain only for data, not for computation. So we will have all the tools we need for 6400x throughput quite soon!

I find it interesting how back in the Roman days the Mediterranean sea was called ""the internal sea"" (or just ""our sea"" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Nostrum…). Very different perspective from our current implicit view of the Mediterranean as a separator between different parts of the world.

Two ways to read this chart:

1. Superpowers as a category are being discredited
2. Reading the fine print, the sample is mostly from European countries, so what's really happening is Europe is becoming more pro-Europe

Either interpretation seems very significant.

Time-based vesting is an ineffective concept when there are liquid markets to hedge the exposure. 

Such markets don't exist for stocks in private companies (crypto will change this) but they do for tokens like $SUSHI.

The electricity cost needed to attack a PoW network is close to negligible. That's precisely why ETC is being spawn-camped right now.

(ASICs mitigate this, but they do so precisely by making a PoW system look a little bit more like PoS, though at the cost of more centralization)

We need to get past the myth that it's *fatal* if one entity gets enough to 51% attack PoS. The reality is they could attack *once*, and then they either get slashed or (if censorship attack) soft-forked away and inactivity-leaked, and they lose their coins so can't attack again.

Sharding, on the other hand, increases the capacity of the base layer by ~100x. This could lead to a 100x decrease in fees, though realistically in the long term it would not decrease quite as much because people's interest in using ethereum (ie. demand) would also increase

The better solution is drastic increases in scalability through (i) rollups, and (ii) sharding. Optimistic and ZK rollups can increase capacity from ~15 tx/sec to ~3000 tx/sec by doing most of the transaction processing on layer 2.

However, increasing capacity is hard to do safely. Ethereum nodes are already running near their limits and there is always the risk of DoS attacks that are much slower to process than regular blocks, slowing the chain to a crawl. Higher gaslimits would exacerbate this.

First of all, why is the gasprice currently 465 gwei? Why isn't it 1000 gwei, or 100 gwei?

The reason is: 465 gwei happens to be the current level at which demand (the number of transactions people are willing to send) equals supply (12.5 million gas of tx space in each block).

Such drama  @lopp did nothing wrong by advising INX, receiving shares, and profiting from a later listing of the asset. He’s smart and honest, good for him.

Maxi’s are just pissed it’s built on Ethereum, which says more about Maxi’s than it does about Lopp, INX, or Ethereum.

If needed we could just allow a feature where you can set the withdrawal key to be an eth1 address, so there would be a contract that would have the rights to future ETH coming out of the validator when it withdraws in phase 1.5+. Those rights could then be ""deposited"" today.

Why was ^ chosen to signify the bitwise XOR operator in C?
Answer: C is the direct descendant of B which already started using ^ as the bitwise XOR operator. [1][2] Ken Thompson used TMG (TransMoGrifiers), a compiler definition tool, to write the B compiler....

My article from 2016: A Proof of Stake Design Philosophy.

https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/a-proof-of-stake-design-philosophy-506585978d51…

A core part of it is how PoS is more true to the cypherpunk spirit because it preserves the property that attacking a chain is much more expensive than defending it, as opposed to PoW's 1:1 cost.

My theory is more moderate. Money printing is only a small portion of governments' budgets, and furthermore it's very naive to think that if govts were forced to shrink their revenue by 10-20% it's the militaries that go first.

The key difference is the more community-oriented emphasis on a kind of ""herd immunity"": the key question is getting to the point where there's enough people in the community doing client-side validation that forcing through an invalid block becomes impractical.

One of the underrated crises of liberalism may be how now pretty much every faction frames itself as fighting some oppressor. Big Government, Big Tech, billionaires, The Cathedral, ""globalists"", [USA | Russia | China]..

When ""fight the power"" can mean anything, it means nothing.

I love how people have been so awkwardly trying to press ethereum on its lack of a preset ""21 million""-like hard cap, when transaction fees the past 2 months have been high enough to more than fully cancel out PoS rewards post-EIP 1559.

Transaction fee revenue is now nearing half as high as block reward revenue. This actually risks making ethereum *less* secure because of https://cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf…. Fee market reform (ie. EIP 1559) fixes this; another reason why that EIP is important.

An economic review of eth2.

Quite well done!

My one qualm is that I think the analysis overestimates PoW attack costs (in particular rental hardware attacks, but even ASIC) so PoS could be safer with less than 13.8% of ETH staking (and hence we don't need to increase rewards)

FWIW I think it's totally not hypocritical for deontic NAP-adherent libertarians to take gov benefits, as long as in total they're taking less than what they paid in taxes.

Zoom’s choice to offer end-to-end encryption to all users is a huge win for user privacy. We hope other tech companies follow suit. https://eff.org/deeplinks/2020/06/victory-zoom-will-offer-end-end-encryption-all-its-users…

Here is my ""nuanced"" view on this. It has a few components. 1) if block limit goes above certain threshold, Ethereum becomes a self-terminating system in the medium/long term. It can have a semblance of alive, but propped by very fragile infrastructure

The #Ethereum miners are voting to increase the Block Gas Limit from 10,000,000 to 12,500,000. 

In theory, this means that the Ethereum network now has the capabilities to handle ~44 transactions per second, instead of ~35. 

Another huge milestone for the community.

Basically, the idea is: if there's no conceivable future that would make you admit your theory is wrong, then your theory is worthless.

The ""halvings cause BTC price rises"" theory is unfalsifiable:

Was the peak before the halving? Then it ""rose in anticipation of the halving""
During? ""Because of the halving""
After? ""Because of...""

The last $20k peak was near the halfway point between the 2016 and 2020 halvings.

One example: marketing. How much should a group promote itself? Promotion is good for the group; at world level, zero is bad (you need *some* to get people interested in things) but too much becomes a form of zero-sum conflict between groups.
