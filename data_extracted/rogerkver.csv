You can send or receive any amount of money with anyone in the world, instantly, basically for free, anonymously, and there is nothing that anyone can do to stop it.

THERE ARE NO GOOD COPS.

1. A cop's job is to enforce the laws, all of them.

2. Many of the laws are unjust, some are even cruel and wicked.

3. Therefore every cop has agreed to act as an enforcer for laws that are unjust or even cruel and wicked.
