It appears that new Parity Ethereum nodes won't do a full sync thanks to a stale bootnode list and incompatibility with Geth bootnodes due to not supporting EIP 2364. You have to manually pass in a reserved_peers file with compatible peer nodes in order to start syncing w/o warp.

Most folks seem to agree it's a horrible idea for central planners to set the price of goods & services since free floating prices are the strongest signals available to markets.

And yet... few seem upset that central planners are setting the price for a critical good: money.
