The irony of #Bitcoin is it was birthed from exponential growth in technology due to decades of globally coordinated, manipulated price signals & cost of capital...and through that, it's going to deliver a head-shot fatality to the corrupt system that incentivized it's existence.

By the way, this #Bitcoin ETF will suck. The tracking error will suck, the fees will suck, the counterparty risk will suck... 

Unless you have serious account restrictions on how you can get access to owning Bitcoin, buy the real stuff.
