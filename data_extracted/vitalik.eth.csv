1% of all ETH is now in the deposit contract!

Updated stats; the decentralization numbers are a bit worse than last time but only because they now properly treat Bitcoin Suisse with their multiple addresses as a single unit. Still doing far better than I expected!

Great example of my point in my recent post: https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html…

Only a convex thinker would ever write the word ""only"" before ""a matter of degree"". To a concave thinker, matters of degree are everything.

Em resposta a @TrustlessState @robustus e @RaoulGMI
the differences between ETH and XRP/ their communities are only in matters of degree
- Both premined
- Both invested in early by Wall St vets
- Both experiment with PoW-less consensus
- Both celebrate bank adoption
... etc. The gentleman doth protest too much, methinks.

yes, well spotted - if you take a circle with 100km / 62 mile radius from the centre of these 4 cities, this is the population total estimate for each

- NYC: 21 million
- London: 20 million
- Tokyo: 42 million
- Dhaka: 57 million

So in fact even if you somehow get slashed ~3 weeks after you join, staking would still probably be net-profitable.

Allowing staking withdrawals to go to arbitrary smart contracts is actually something that we could potentially enable very easily today (or if we want to respect the spec freeze, in the first hard fork after phase 0). Certainly worth discussing at least.

If needed we could just allow a feature where you can set the withdrawal key to be an eth1 address, so there would be a contract that would have the rights to future ETH coming out of the validator when it withdraws in phase 1.5+. Those rights could then be ""deposited"" today.

Though what's done is done... I recommend we just  normalize using ** for exponentiation in math if you can't superscript.

Why was ^ chosen to signify the bitwise XOR operator in C?
Answer: C is the direct descendant of B which already started using ^ as the bitwise XOR operator. [1][2] Ken Thompson used TMG (TransMoGrifiers), a compiler definition tool, to write the B compiler....

An economic review of eth2.

Quite well done!

My one qualm is that I think the analysis overestimates PoW attack costs (in particular rental hardware attacks, but even ASIC) so PoS could be safer with less than 13.8% of ETH staking (and hence we don't need to increase rewards)

Arrgh, I understand that the media keeps getting this wrong, but can you please not perpetuate this?

This Synthetix demo is *absolutely not* ""inside an opti-rollup"".

As a community, we will trust our miners to work on altruism and hope that users will pay $1,000 tx fees.

Another canard that won’t die. 

Property taxes are close to consumption not wealth taxes, and are also meant to be somewhat proportional to the value of actual community services received.

NIST's chart of ""when do you need a blockchain?""

IMO it's overly pessimistic in some areas. For example, for auditing use cases, you should just publish Merkle roots of your data on-chain, ie. Plasma without the exit game.

This is also useful for privacy-demanding use cases.

When computing the average of two numbers, yes, (a+b)/2 is the definition, but it's often a very suboptimal algorithm for *calculating* it in practice. Most of the time, you want a + (b-a)/2; numbers that get averaged tend to be close together so this requires less computation.
