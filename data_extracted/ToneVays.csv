Solution to END Lockdowns:
Since the PCR test has an approximate 5% false positive rate, every person should go get tested 20 times. Then statistically EVERYONE will have #Covid19 so I'm not sure what bullshit reason they will have to keep destroying people's lives.

Hew come when a billionaire like Jaimie Diamond or Warren Buffet say ""Gov't Can & Should Destroy #Bitcoin"" we all laugh cause we know they can't.
But when a #crypro billionaire says ""Miners Can & Should Destroy #Bitcoin"" every1 comes out of the woodwork assuming this is possible?

If #Bitcoin drops under $2K you give me 100 $BTC = $200K that day.
If it does NOT drop under $2K, I give you $250K or 1 BTC (whichever has a higher $ denominated value)
I have until 2024 halving to be sure $2k won't happen :)
