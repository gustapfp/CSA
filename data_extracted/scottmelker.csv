Pro tip for haters and trolls: if you choose to sh*t on someone, especially about a trade, make sure you don’t spike the ball and do your TD dance at the one yard line.

I have been intermittent fasting for 2 months, eating 6-8 hours a day and fasting 16-18. 

I’ve lost some weight. Cool. 

Net result thus far really is - I’m hungry. 

Definitely harder for me to concentrate when hungry, not seeing the mental benefits thus far.

This price action is brutal for bears, because it's been a slow grind upwards with minimal supply and selling. It's easy to jump out or flip bias when there's a huge move that changes structure. It's much harder when it moves steadily.

When #Bitcoin is trading at a few hundred thousand dollars a coin (or a million) in the future, I doubt you will be concerned with whether you bought it at 37k or 30k. 

Zoom out and enjoy the 50% off sale. 

Sure, it may drop more, but if you’re an investor you shouldn’t care.

I have definitely taken more losing trades in my life than winning trades. In the past few years I’ve learned to let the winners run and quickly cut bait with the losers, and my hit rate has improved. But I still lose at least 3-4 out of every ten trades, when I’m trading.

You cannot save dollars anymore. There are unlikely to be interest bearing accounts that beat inflation ever again.

Dollars are strictly for spending. 

To accumulate wealth, you have to buy other assets. 

#Bitcoin is my favorite, by far. But I'm also buying land, art, stocks.

If you are in the US and you trade alts and only take profit into Bitcoin, you are setting yourself up for a potential world of hurt come tax time. 

You owe up to 37% of the profit from that trade in USD, no matter what happens after the day you transacted.

LOL at people screaming double top. 

To confirm a double top requires a break of the swing low between the two tops. 

That would require a break of $3,100, target around negative 16K.

What is wrong with people?

Sounds like the election is extremely close, no states have officially flipped yet, and Trump is implying early victory and claiming the Democrats are cheating.

If you use a stop loss and size your position properly, you will know exactly how much you intend to lose on any trade. 

This eliminates fear and indecision from trading, because you've already mentally lit the money on fire when you execute the trade.

If that asset goes down, you can end up paying taxes on gains that were never realized.

Approach EVERY SINGLE trade or investment on a brand new DeFi project or coin as if you expect it to go to 0. 

Period.

Size your position accordingly.

I am not saying the projects are bad, many are amazing. But you should always plan your loss, not your gain.

Money does not change a person, it just allows them to be the asshole they always wanted to be with less consequences.

The primary purpose behind derivatives is the transfer of risk without the need to trade the underlying asset. This allows for more effective risk management. In addition, the derivatives market plays a role in information discovery (setting a future price) and market efficiency.

I am long, but obviously cognizant of the fact that another drop is possible, if not likely.

You can’t copy someone else’s trades and expect to copy their results. Every person manages a trade differently and has a different risk profile. That’s why you need your own system.

Twitter is great for finding trade IDEAS, but should not be used for finding specific trades.

I have my face and name on my profile. I share more than most. My parents and family follow me, as do my oldest friends. They would know if I was lying and would call me on it.

Yet I am called a ""larper"" by anonymous people on a daily basis.

The FED is being pressured to react to the virus, which is dangerous. QE and cuts now before understanding the full breadth of impact could leave them with no dry powder when they need it most. Rate cuts and QE can't fight a black swan event - they can just take the edge off.

Sad truth. The best thing for financial markets could be a quick spread of the disease and then for things to normalize, dealing with it like we do the flu. It is unlikely that the disease will stop spreading, The longer it takes, the more fear and uncertainty we will feel.

A pattern is completely irrelevant without context. What is bearish in one spot is bullish in another. We look at patterns to understand the emotions of the people trading the asset. You NEVER trade a pattern that ""may happen"" or an incomplete idea. Confirmation is key.

If you ask someone a question like “will X ever hit 1000,” “is Y going to bounce here” or “is Z dead,” and someone gives you a definitive answer - unfollow them. None of us can tell the future, and anyone that says they can is selling you something.

Everything in trading is about context. Nobody can tell you when it’s appropriate to enter or exit a position. It all depends on your personal goals, expectations, timeline, risk tolerance and financial situation. A clear sell for someone is a longer hold for someone else.

Almost every alt I am watching has a potential oversold bull div on the hourly. I am not buying, but watching to see what happens. If they do start to make lower lows, higher time frame bull divs will likely start to appear.

Miles Jordan Melker. 7 lb 6 oz, 19.5 inches. Just played some Rachmaninoff, dunked on LeBron, headlined Coachella and solved Fermat’s Theorem. Picked Penn over Harvard like his old man. Not bad for his first few hours. (Second choice was Miles Wolf Melker - almost made it happen)

A sell off of 5000 $BTC right now would bring price to $6300 on Bitfinex. A buying spree of 5000 #bitcoin would take price to $7700. Meaning? It's a lot easier to move price way up then a little bit down at this time.
