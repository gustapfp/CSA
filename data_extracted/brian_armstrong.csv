Interesting how crypto communities are congregating on Discord, which has traditionally been used for gaming. The intersection between gaming and crypto will be huge. (Reminder: it's also intersecting with art, finance, identity, governance, etc...Crypto is eating the world.)

1/ I do worry that as companies get to be more successful, the number of attacks from press, politicians, and trolls on CEOs (and rounds of congressional testimony) makes the job not fun, and they leave from burn out. Gates, Page, Bezos...

Would you rather use a self-custody or Coinbase-custody wallet to access Defi/NFTs from the main Coinbase app? Why?

If fiat backed stablecoins really become inflation coins (not so stable), then how will we get a coin that is truly stable?

Perhaps something that tracks a basket of real world goods (purchasing power parity) using oracles?

Ideas welcome.

By one measure it is getting harder and harder to get hired at Coinbase:

Applicants per hire 2019/2020/2021 => 108/133/150

1/ There are a few key moments that define our future. One is happening now in the Senate w/ the infrastructure bill. At the 11th hour 
@MarkWarner
 has proposed an amendment that would decide which foundational technologies are OK and which are not in crypto. This is disastrous.

1/ If you’ve been following threads on the Infrastructure bill, you know that there is a hastily conceived provision related to digital assets. This provision could have a profound negative impact on crypto in the US and unintentionally push more innovation offshore.

Have been using an

Using the day off to do some writing/thinking about the future. Good way to clarify thinking is to force yourself to write something down (concisely/clearly) in a few pages.

Would not surprise me if 
@paradigm
 was one of the top performing funds of the last few years if not #1. Not just because of recent crypto prices (lots rode those), but the early stage companies they invested in. Someone should check....who does leaderboards for such things?

Happy new year! Excited for the rest of the decade, and a repeat of the roaring 20's.

Whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger. Despite a tough year, science and technology had so many advances that we will emerge better.
