I wonder how crypto VC investing dynamics would change if instead of “4 year vesting” for VCs being a 1 year cliff and 3 years linear, it was actually a 4 year cliff. 

Increases a lot of existing low float problems but also requires higher conviction VCs.

Dumb idea: One Dollar DAO. 

Form a DAO. 

Everyone contributes only $1 in exchange for 1 DAO token. Probably have to do KYC so that it’s not gameable to make sure $1 per person max limit. 

High voting consensus threshold (>60%) to take actions / use treasury.

See what happens.

If u dump 100% of ur vested position while tweeting bullish things about a low cap, it doesn’t matter if u were explicitly paid to tweet about it or not. Decoy narrative. You’re tweeting bullish things about a low cap while selling every coin u can sell. Who cares if u were paid

I visited my parents house because we had a funeral in the family yesterday. While there, I collected an old laptop from 2013. I found a dogecoin wallet from when I used to try to mine shit

Thrilled, I waited for it to sync. This is my big moment

Balance: 0

Instead of taxes the US government should simply help hundreds of teams do ICOs and then have the SEC sue them for a % of the fundraise over and over.

Pros:

- Raises more money than taxes
- Fun
- Crypto volume stays high
- No more taxes

Cons:
- Nothing I can think of

Cobie Trading Tip 6685:

If your position is underwater, just go to bed. Go to sleep. 

Don’t get out of bed until your position is green again. 

The red negative number is only there to scare you. Sleep through it instead. 

Use as much sleep medication as you need.

If the fed hits that target, the value of today’s dollar will only be worth a third of its current value in 50 years.

If my understanding of crypto law is correct then Arthur has two strategies:

1. Tell them that actually a DAO is in charge of Bitmex so it’s not illegal.

I think social media's propagation of ""the Joneses"" life is toxic and is rotting your brain. 

2017/18 was a crazy good couple years for me, and I still spent a lot of the time feeling anxious: greed, envy, desolate. 

In 2019 I will try to both consume and contribute less.
