Them: “Is that stuff still around?”

You buy.

Just paid a Europe-based influencer via PayPal. Not only did PayPal charge me a conversion rate fee but it also got the rate completely wrong. Now this person thinks I purposely shorted them while I actually payed more in the process. I hate PayPal. This doesn't happen in crypto.
