As we are approaching the 10th anniversary of Litecoin, I figured it's a good time to do a long Twitter  on the history of Litecoin from my perspective.

My memory of events can be hazy at times, so for those mentioned, feel free to add or correct anything I say. Here goes...

I see a lot of parallels between 2021's NFTs with 2017's ICOs and 2013's altcoins:

- easy to create new ones with no barriers
- simple to understand & explain
- brings tons of new people into crypto
- high prices & pumps create hype/FOMO
- few will hold & have value, most won't
