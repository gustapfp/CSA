I see these motivational quotes all over social media

""Work now so you enjoy your spoils later""

Bullshit.

Life is short if you don't make time to enjoy it you're doing it wrong.
The only thing that attitude is gonna get you is a burnout in your early 30s.

If you're looking for a holy grail in trading let me tell you this:

The closest you can get is making sure to never be at risk of blowing up and putting in time

It's interesting how risk appetite changes over time

Back when I started in crypto I was willing to bet 100% (and then some) of my NW on it going up.

Nowadays I'd go nowhere close to that.

Lots of arguments on the TL about whether you should hold BTC or alts

Bears trying to short here remind me of how I traded in 18

I knew the market was bearish, I had made a bunch of money on the way down and was looking to compound.

It took some haircuts to realize that bear market rallies can go higher than felt logical.

Is this time different?

People keep saying shorting is evil.
That is wrong.

There are two outcomes to shorting

1) A winner

The bear buys back when the market goes down creating buy pressure into the drop, the market doesn't vanish

2) A loser

The bear is fuel for the rip up

I think the bigger the Coinbase IPO gets the better for exchange tokens.

Doesn't matter that owning an exchange token ≠ actually owning stock

Just matters that a lot of people will feel priced out of coinbase

I like to judge the strength of a market by how it reacts to news.

If we rally during the course of this week, all is good.

If we can't rally off of positive Tether news I'll expect some chop at best.

If we dump off of positive news I'll expect more dumpage.

While altcoins are losing a lot of their value against BTC today it is important to note that they've shown massive strength in spite of BTCs rally.

There is demand for them, it's just overshadowed by BTC.

If they discount in any way due to big BTC volatility, some are a buy.

Kind of funny how a bear market warps perspectives.

The BTC moon used to be $100k+ - now it's 10k or lower
The alts were supposed to take over BTC - now people dream for ETH to get back above $100
BTC was supposed to defeat the banks - now everyone hopes for them to invest in it

Tip for ranging markets like this one:
If you're holding altcoins on an exchange it might be smart to setup sells 20%-50% above price.
That way when the PnDs get to it you'll get to rebuy more at the accumulation floor.

1:1 educational chat with @CewisLarroll was a lot of fun!
The next free one will be at march 1st.

I'd do these more often but they do take up a lot of time so I sadly can't.

Trading isn't as simple as:

If this happens -> Do this.
If it was we'd all be rich.

The only magic formula that does exist is risk management.
If you're able to take 10 losses in a row without getting wiped out you'll also be able to take the 10 wins that come right after.

During a downtrend however be very suspicious of bull patterns.

As a new trader ignore the orderbook.
The buy and sell walls are not there to provide resistance or support.
They're there to get you to buy or sell.
And don't even start thinking about outsmarting the orderbook, that's a fools game.

TA based on an order book is bad TA.

The only way BTC doesn't crash is if everyone turns bearish before it does.

Just because you made money trading altcoins doesn't mean you know how to margin trade.
I've burned out 3 Forex demo accounts before trading a real account.
I traded tiny amounts until I got consistently profitable.

When you take a trade always remember there is someone doing the exact opposite trade, betting against you.
Try to figure out their reasoning for doing so and only execute if yours is superior.

Don't use an indicator as your primary buy or sell signal.
Establish where you think price is likely to find support/resistance and then check for confluence between these levels and your indicators.

Chart first and then indicator up not the other way around.

Checklist before entering a trade:

1) Is my TA giving me an entry?
2) Will BTC give this trade time to develop?
3) Is my risk:reward ratio justifiable?
4) Do I have an exit plan if the trade doesn't work out?
