Bitcoin has been contaminated by Tribalism, which is one of the many reasons why its long-term success is implausible.

For us to compete against the corrupt financial system, we need to promote more open-minded, realistic, and innovative values within the crypto community.

I find it very interesting that SEC allowed the #Bitcoin ETF to launch on Monday, the exact day Evergrande is expected to default. 

What if Wall Street is expecting a Black Monday/Tuesday for Stocks, and needed something to tank the crypto markets too?

The manufactured hype we’re witnessing now is a nothingburger, and huge bull trap by Wall St.

The ETF explicitly uses futures, which is a mixture of cash & derivatives, which means no real Bitcoin will be traded.

When #Bitcoin was at $29,300 the other day, I warned late-sellers and shorters to be prepared for a pump. 

$BTC has since surged, and the narrative has instantly changed. 

IMO this is a clear bull trap, all coins will move higher for a bit, then fall off a cliff afterwards.

Important message as we enter the #Bitcoin bear market:

- Buying up here is risky
- You can lose all of your money
- Don’t FOMO in on tiny bounces
- Don’t try catching a falling knife
- Follow bears, not bulls
- Control your emotions
- Buy the crash, not the dip
- Be patient

The world is shutting down again. 

And people are blindly jumping into an asset that plunged over 60% during the last wave of lockdowns in Feb-March. 

If it isn’t obvious already, #Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, and a list of other things, but not a global pandemic.

People get so furious when 1 of my calls is in the red, but ignore all my other calls this year. 

I said to short the markets in February, and made huge gains on the 60% crash from 10.5K to sub 4K.

I said to buy in March at 3.9K, and BTC and Alts went up over 150%.

People with unrealistic expectations for their investments are bound to be disappointed.

I saw someone say XRP and BTC would have a market-cap of $300 trillion by the end of 2021.

As much as I like these coins, people need to stop basing their predictions off wishful thinking.

Nobody ever regrets...

- Working out
- Taking a walk
- Going to sleep early
- Eating a healthy meal
- Investing money in an asset
- Staying off social media for the day
- Being moderate about drinking/drugs

Let’s not forget that the infamous crypto scam, Bitconnect, rose to around $400, and had a market cap of $2.6 billion before they went bust.

The government printed enough money to give each and every person in America over $50,000. 

Instead, they gave them a measly $1,500. The rest was deposited to the uber elites. 

The system doesn’t care about poor people. They are just slaves for the rich.

Meaning the unemployment rate will grow even larger.

99% of noobs do the following: 

 They BUY an asset when it’s green, and going up. 

 They SELL an asset when it’s red, and going down. 

This has something to do with human psychology, although is a terrible habit.

INVESTMENT ADVICE:

When you first start investing.

Use a PAPER TRADING account.

This is where you trade on live markets with fake money.

-You get used to your trading platform.

-If you make mistakes, it doesn't matter.

-You get used to the emotion of stock volatility.

Leverage is a tool mainly used by inexperienced investors that want more profits on funds they DON'T have.

Using margin while trading is similar to taking out a loan from a bank to trade. Not a good idea!

I often use very LOW, or NO leverage when trading the markets!

From the 2nd halving in 2016 to the top of the 2017 price peak ($19,400), the Bitcoin price jumped ~29X. 

Prior to the last halving, Bitcoin is up 1,570% today and the next halving occurs in less than 2 weeks!

29X from here would put a single #Bitcoin  at $200,000!

If you miss a trade - that’s okay. It’s not the end of the world. 

Although, what you do next is just as important. Many will open a quick position without thinking too much. 

But sometimes the best choice is to wait a day or two for the markets to stabilize!

It’s much harder to go to war from silk sheets, and there is real honour in making your own way.

As your means begin to outweigh your needs, you naturally should start allocating capital prudently.

#Bitcoin doesn’t have preferences

You can be:
- Any country’s citizen
- Any religion
- Any race
- Any gender
- Any political belief 
- Any social class

Everybody is included.

What a beautiful concept.

It blows my mind how people are still racist in todays age....

Everyone should be treating equally no matter what color they are. 

Ones personality and behaviour isn’t determined by their color, but rather where and how they were raised.

Canada's top bank economists predict the country will see a few bright spots in 2020, even as the globe grapples with uncertainty in the Middle East and China.

I disagree and think Canada and USA are nearing a recession. Global uncertainties will eventually scare investors.

I have several Bitcoin wallets but in total, they amount to around $5,500,000 USD. 

I'm almost certain that this amount will grow in years from now once Bitcoin sees an influx in demand caused by a global economic crisis.

Bitcoin and Gold both follow global trends in the world.

For example, during the US-IRAN situation yesterday, both assets moved upwards.

We know a global recession is coming, and this is bullish for both Gold and Bitcoin. I would highly recommend stacking a lot of it.

Trump should not retaliate after Iran’s fail attempt at launching missiles at the U.S army base.

Countries such as Canada, UK, France etc, should all denounce Iran’s clear attempts at trying to start a war.

This needs to end! #NoWarWithlran

People need to understand that nobody wants to go to war with Iran, including Donald Trump.

He will announce tomorrow that they will be ending the conflict. Mark my words.

The war ideas are being spread by the media, which are mainly to scare people.

Obama sent Iranians billions of dollars during his presidency.

Trump sent them the death of a terrorist who’s murdered thousands.

Tell me again why Trump is the worst?

Governments and Banks know they cannot outright Ban Bitcoin because of how it’s designed, so what they do is use market manipulations to decrease its price, thus decreasing demand.

Bitcoin Options on January 13th will be interesting! Potential crash near then!

Bernie Sanders will likely win the next presidency for the United States, and a recession will happen around that time. 

The economy wouldn’t look to good with a socialist in office, especially one with plans exceeding tens of trillions of dollars.

#Ethereum is significantly undervalued. 

While it hovers well below the $200 mark, people forget to realize that this asset is responsible for the hype we saw during the last bull run.

The fundamentals drove the ICO bubble, and in years from now, it will easily be 2k+

The ability that the Fed has in managing the economy and preventing a recession will likely result in a much larger financial crisis in the future.

The US economy hasn’t had a recession peroid in over a decade for the first time in history. 

A recession is coming and while no one knows exactly when, it’s a safe bet to diversify your portfolio into gold, and crypto’s. 

Fiat/Traditional Finance is risky....

Many Democrats are showing their support for the terrorist Iranian regime out of spite of Donald #Trump.

Regardless of your political views, and personal opinions on him, there’s no denying that #Iran is the main cause of violence in the Middle East.
