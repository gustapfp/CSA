Bottom line on the FinCEN rules (as I predicted): If you try to make payments from a regulated exchange they will require additional verification and will report your transactions to the government. 

If you use your own wallet... they can't and won't control or report on you.

There's no such thing as a ""self-hosted"" wallet. It's just a ""wallet"". 

If a wallet is in my pocket we don't call it a self-pocket wallet. If it's in someone else's pocket, it's their wallet, not a ""hosted"" wallet. 

These terms are propaganda with sinister intent

Don't overreact to the phishing scams that target hardware wallet buyers

Hardware wallets are some of the best mechanisms we have to store crypto. 

Compromising a website database is not at all the same as compromising the security of the hardware wallet.

The Senate passed a $740 billion ""defense"" bill. 

Almost a trillion dollars, given to private companies & the death machine. 

They voted to symbolically rename Confederate bases, but also more funds for DHS, CBP, ICE who brutalize Americans and immigrants.

Why is this Twitter post hack happening to cryptocurrency related accounts? Are they less secure?

No, it's because an attack against this industry is immediately monetized.

You wanted ""institutional investors"" and ""mainstream adoption""?

This is what it looks like: Absent the principles of decentralization, traded as a high-volatility asset to add ""spice"" to a portfolio.
