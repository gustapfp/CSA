I firmly believe that to reach 100-200k per bitcoin we need to absolutely obliterate everybody with a blow off top and longer-than-normal sideways so everyone thinks it is ""over"" and hype dies down.

eg. Blow off top to 50-60k soonish and consolidation/sideways until October.

- $BTC is lagging equities weakness and it's just a matter of time until if follows suit.

We can't go up in a straight line. 

If this is going to trade higher and thru the range high, this is the kinda action I'd be interested in longing the dip on. 

Too much sustained time below the EQ of the range and I like it less.

This seems like the optimal place to hedge your longs or TP.

We've had a strong move off the lows and it's the weekend.

I'm currently flat, missed the bottom long like a pleb.

If we reject here I'll attempt to long a HL. If we continue up I'll long a flip of the quarterly open

Rough idea of what I'm looking for here on #Bitcoin. 

Break down and we can catch a short down to the range lows.

If we break out above the daily SFP, I'll try and hope into a long into the quarterly open.

Daily close as an SFP but I like the reclaim of the range. 

I didn't long the bottom so I'm waiting for a pull back or a flip of $32.5k to get long.

Seeing a lot of demand showing up at the $32k level, ran all but 1 low (may still get run).

#Bitcoin 

H12 SFP, upper part of the range = short.

This is exactly what I was looking for in my previous post. Managed to catch a really nice entry on a short over night.

Watching this grey zone, if we find support I'll cut shorts and long.

If we lose the grey we go to $32k.

While I am leaning long bias, hold this grey zone for a move to the range high - $40k. 

I am watching for any potential weakness to short. We've made a lower low on the H12.

Still in a range and will still be cautious as we approach range highs.

Daily close was indeed pretty chad.

Let's see if we can now hold the midrange as support. 

If we can put some LTF bullish market structure in the grey box, that's the long you take into $40k.

That said we are at a key point, 2770 (prev monthly close). 

I want to see us break and hold above here, any sort of break above that is rejected is bearish and I'd short the underside down into the low $2ks. 

Hold above and I like $3100.

Uploading video shortly and then will stream later.

This is a great scalping environment. As for spot buys it's tough down here but I'll be bidding the low end of the range on $BTC and $ETH.

Safer move is to wait for a low to form and then get in on reclaim.

Most HTFs I watch have made bearish market structure, weekly is still holding on. 

Don't want to see weekly break MS.

Could we hit $45k and pump? Sure, would be a LTF play.

Based on the weekly I think the bid is $38k-$40k and pray it's just a wick.

$ETH

I see 0 reason to short ETH up here, would wait for some sign of weakness first.

That said, if you are playing this on margin, we are working on our 7th green daily in a row. 

Probably not a terrible idea to start planning an exit or at least locking in some gains.

Momentum was clearly slowing, so price cooling off by pulling back and going side ways is a good thing.

Indicators cool off (RSI etc), allow for another strong leg up.

50% fib (lines up with daily OB) and grey block are where I think this bounce tops.

Good spot to hedge/TP longs.

If we flip that grey box, I think we fly thru ATH. 

More likely IMO is we get a pull back, hopefully into a higher low around $48k.

Market looking a little heavy. 

A rinse out to the downside isn’t a bad thing.

Zoom out and mark daily support, start planning areas to watch for dip buys.

Would love to buy $42-$43k if given, might be too greedy though.

Wherever this dips to is just a higher low before $50k.

Price pushing right back up to it again today, not shorting a 2nd test.

Flip this grey and I will break out long to a new ATH.

Market feels a little heavy.

Strong bounce after last nights dump all into resistance and potential lower highs.

Not saying it's over but IMO not a place to long into.

Out of leverage positions, profit off table.

Will rebuy on S/R flips.

Looking a lot more likely now. 

Starting to cover short into $17.6k and down.

Looking for bullishness from $17-$17.6k, should provide a nice long opp. 

I expect that bounce to results in a lower high, but just going to play level to level.

$18.7 is daily support, as long as we hold that I think we continue to chop.

Regain the $19.3-$19.5k area and we will go to ATH and probably over extend, $22k-$25k.

Lose $18.7k and I think $17.2k is a long.

Let's not discuss what'll happen is we lose $17.2k.

So, what if these Alt pumps get everyone chasing them, BTC gives one more upside push then corrects 30-40%. All alts get rekt and then the real trend continues.

Large investors and institutions are still not worried about inflation, as evidenced by low bond yields. When they finally start to worry, they will buy #gold, not #Bitcoin. The main buyers of Bitcoin are small speculators and a few fund managers who are taking advantage of them.

Yes this move is extended and vertical but we are still in an uptrend.

If you don't know what to do, long until you are wrong (

Daily support levels are clear and all still intact. 

Eventually one gets flipped and you take an L and flip bias.

What was your first car CT? 

Mine was a 1988 Toyota Cressida that I bought from my grandma with only 60,000kms on it. 

It had a digital speedometer and automatic windows and seats it was truly luxurious.

I put 2 twelve inch subs in the trunk and rode it into the ground.

There is a lot of room to move up on the $DXY. That bullishness in conjunction with #Bitcoin looking like ass makes me think we will be fulfilling that CME gap fill narrative.

Still think we see more downside on ETH based on the market structure that is shaping up.

2 charts attached, bulls need to get price back above $400. To me $280-$290 seems like the draw.

Hoping $BTC pushes up towards $11k to short, ETH looks weaker.

If the Dollar can get above the upper grey box, 95 is the minimum target I'm looking for.

Two main scenarios I'm watching on $DXY from my 'Metals with Mayne' stream.

Looking like a potential 3 drives bottom forming, if that is the case we could see a strong bounce. That'd mean major shorts for $BTC, $XAU, $XAG.

Alternatively if $DXY continues down we look for longs!

Back above $11,500 after sweeping some lows. Red box is resistance, thru there and I'm expecting $12k swiftly. Reject and I'll look for $10,500.

$ETH

Structurally looks better to me than BTC and may be leading a break out here. If ETH breaks high I'm expecting $440.

Got the bounce I was expecting and pushed deep into the zone. We failed to close thru or take out the previous high.

Keeping a close eye on $SPX as it approaches ATH, Gold/Silver fell off hard, any pull back on equities I think will be confluent with BTC moving to $10.5.

One of the reasons I like higher time frame trading is because I don't need to spend much time at all looking at the chart.

- Mark key W or D level
- Set an alert
- Wait
- The alert goes off, pull up the chart, zoom into my execution time frame, and look for a set up.

Price bounced off support and is now testing the upper threshold. I'm still watching for a short near the red if I can get it.

On the bull side, we have broken out of a falling wedge into support and $SPX looks like it wants 3100 to me so maybe this pumps hard.

Red block is key for me, if we reject from there it'll confirm distribution above March's high and I expect much lower.

If we can reclaim the red block I am looking to long a pullback to $11k.

I think there is a long opp here with decent RR, talked about in-stream yesterday around the 27-minute mark.

Thanks for tuning in peeps! 

Summary
- BTC is a risk asset and behaving like one
- Equities market isn't out of the woods yet
- That could potential be bad news for BTC
- Short as close to $8k+ as possible or long potential dip $6.5-6.8 for one more leg up.
- Copious swearing

If I take off my BTC bull goggles and just look at price action the HTF on BTC looks pretty disgusting. 

The bull case is that the wick to 3600 was capitulation and the bottom is now in. I hope this is the case because if it's not and equities nuke hard in Q2, yikes.

My plan from a few days ago. I was hoping to get this reaction during the week for a long, I don't really like entering a position on the weekend.

$6400-$6600 is an area to watch if we reject we'll likely see downside continuation.

Nice to see my plan playing out so far.

If you watched my last YouTube video I covered why this was my plan, what I expected to happen and how I planned on executing. I'll do an update video either tomorrow or Monday.

Hedged most of my #bitcoin now in the grey. This has been my plan for weeks, sticking to it.

We could go higher, but I think the temperature on CT and how far we've already run are inline with a pullback.

Could be wrong, don't care, do you.

Watching $9.5k, $8.7k, $7.6k.

I was hoping for lower to get long but this buy back is pretty strong. 

Saw at couple 10 mil liqs on that dump and 100 mil was wiped off the OI on Mex. CME gap also filled.

Hedging into this grey block. I've been riding spot longs since $7k so selling some #Bitcoin and having to potential rebuy slightly higher if I'm wrong is fine with me.

Last 5 months have conditioned people to short every pump, causing many to miss this 30% move.

Shorting dips in an uptrend is low probability, look at my feed in Aug-Sept I was longing pumps in a downtrend.

We're approaching a HH on the weekly.

Short the red, no sooner.

Per my video last night I’m personally sitting out til I see what happens with the monthly and weekly close. 

It’s ok to miss trades. 

That break above the range defines your risk and a break below and pull back is your entry if you wanna short. 

Target $8700-$8800

Updating charts from stream, Gold PA comparison much clearer now. Key support level I want us to hold is $8500, which is the H4 MS shift.

Pushing thru a daily bearish OB, close thru here I expect a range high test. If we reject here likely back to range lows.

I've set break out bids at the range high incase we don't pullback. If we do pullback I am bidding around $7200.

We've been ranging for 45 days, whichever way this breaks you don't want to fade. 

3D bullish engulfing, weekly SFP still in play hence remaining bull bias.

Wondering where to dip your feet in that frontside counter-trend reversal? Same. I was tired of getting smoked by too eagerly reversing range impulses, so I came up with this, and it's pretty clutch.

If we can get another dip below $8k, it'd look like a nice triple stop reversal into our weekly block. 

Long the fuck outta sub $8k is the move IMO.

$BTC has pulled back 40%+ multiple times in bull markets and recovered quickly. Will this time be different? I say no, I could be wrong but getting bearish after a 40% drop is usually a bad idea even in the bear market.

I still think $7.5k, chop, form a HL then $16k is possible.

Buying daily support has been the move of $BTC this entire uptrend. 

It is very easy to over-complicate trading, sometimes keeping it simple is best.

Fresh chart paints a simple picture. 

No need to rush into a position until we clear these levels to the upside or downside. The in-between is chop city and feels like a coin flip.

Patience is key, I'm going to let PA develop at a clear HTF level before making a trade.

Seeing a bounce as expected, the question is how high will it go? 

$9700-$9900 is where I am scaling in for another push-down. That said, we've formed a HL on the H4 and a push towards the MO ($107xx) isn't out of the question. If stopped I'll try again higher.

On support, if you shorted the move down pay yourself a piece here as we should react, I think you short the bounce.

H4 block and a Daily OB (black line is the top of it) from the initial move to $13,xxx. This is a significant level for me, we lose this area $8xxx soon.

A lot of peeps talking about Gold rn makes sense we're at major res that has been tested multiple times. Once we break thru I expect major upside. Gold trades clean levels, look for bullish MS on ur fav TF, wait for a pullback.

A potential short, not sure if we get it would be a lower high at $8700. If we can regain $8700 I think you get net long AF.

$ETH - USD pair needs to break and close thru $260 to get to $300. BTC pair had a nice reaction of range low if we can hold EQ and flip grey OB looks good.

When funding looks like this and the weekly looks like this, don't short. You are paying to short strength and it makes no sense. It doesn't matter how good the RR is, you are better off taking lower RR longs as you will at least be trading with the trend.

CT is wild lately. I think most people have no clue and were caught with their pants down.

IMO there were TA reasons to pullback & fundamentals added to it. What's more important is what you're doing now.

Last premium divergence between Mex and Finex - fireworks.

The bearish argument, we hit a monthly s/r level, just about hit the daily block at $5500 and have retraced 2/3rds of the 6k sell-off.

If this was the top of the move, we've created a HH, now you want to look to buy a HL.

As long as $BTC holds the grey blocks $alts can play. I do want to see it move away with some volume to continue being bullish. I still like $4100+ if the grey holds, if not $35xx.

$ETH looks worse to me and needs to regain $136.70. Following the analysis from the stream nicely.

I am still in my $BTC short, stop out at an H4 close thru $3960. If I get stopped out I'll most likely try and short again from $4100 to as high as $4500 on weakness.

I have some alt exposure (ETH long, ADA long) right now and those will act as a hedge against me shorting BTC.

BTC following the squiggly, if we break thru here I expect a move to $4100.

I longed ETH last night, above $136>$147 above $147>$172.

I think it’s important to give context on what you’re seeing in alts atm; why it’s happening now; and what to expect.

Whilst no one can time markets perfectly, there’s a number of reasons why many of us have been anticipating a cyclical shift since 2019.

Not trying to be a perma-bear but if we have another bullrun, buying in portions this year might be the smartest decision you ever make. Don't blow your load all at once.

If you buy 1 $BTC at $3500 and 1 at $1500 (which turns out is the bottom) your avg is $2500, not bad IMO.

Are we at the 1st arrow on the chart or the 2nd arrow?

If this $BTC cycle ends like the last, we'll see a bullish monthly candle form that price will consolidate at before starting an uptrend.

I'm leaning towards arrow 1 but I'm happy to be wrong.

I’m confident most people would get a better entry averaging into $BTC on red days at these prices, and possibly lower rather than trying to snipe the bottom. Most of you didn’t sell the top what makes you think you’ll buy the bottom?

Not interested in this chop TBH. Made a few silly mistakes trying to trade the range when there have been some clear moves available in the FX.

Will enter a trade on a break of either key level, alarms set.

I've included the $DXY chart to support the meme that isn't a meme. 

I am out of 75% of this trade with my stop at 2R ($3588) playing with house money. 

Overall I am still leaning bearish unless we close thru the range EQ. Would enter short around $3560.

I don't have a super clear read on PA right now. Longs make more sense than shorts down here IMO.

Bulls
- Holding above key HTF support
- Any selling below being bought up
- Clear upside target above yearly open

Bears
- Lower highs
- Bounces weak
- Resistance above

A lot of people messaging me about Library Coin as they know I've been bitching about this bag forever and it's finally pumped.

A lesson in how rekt altcoins can get you, even after the pump its had it'd still need to do another 500% for me to breakeven.

I normally don’t talk about politics much because it’s so divisive. But JFC people stop blaming other people, systems, institutions etc for your problems. Take ownership of decisions YOU make. This rings all too true in crypto Twitter. A victims mentality is a losers mentality.

Can't step away from these markets for a second!

Daily chart closed gross and the 3D closes tmrw, if it looks how it does now and we close below the EQ and monthly open I'll expect a deeper pullback.

I'd long a pullback to $3450-$3600 or if we regain the monthly open.

If we close the weekly under the monthly open and EQ of the block I like my odds.

Getting back under the red block would offer another short opportunity on the retest.

It's been a long time Since I've been Bullish on $BTCUSD. My best guess, 2nd Week of February right after the Crash to $6k, we rallied all the way to $12k. I see a similar path for #Bitcoin this time, but 2x to $8k might be a stretch.

Grey block is a M-OB and the 2 black lines are a W-OB. AKA still a lot of res above.

Zoom into the daily we have a S/R flip and a +OB. 

I'd like a retest of the +OB. Red -OB is T1 if that breaks T2 is the EQ.

Patience is key.

Grey block is a M-OB and the 2 black lines are a W-OB. AKA still a lot of res above.

Zoom into the daily we have a S/R flip and a +OB. 

I'd like a retest of the +OB. Red -OB is T1 if that breaks T2 is the EQ.

EQ of D1 OB held 2x ($6818) forming lower highs + Closed weekly below the EQ of the W OB ($6612) = bearish

Bears - Lower line doesn't hold we'll see $61xx and below there not sure the OB hold.

Bulls - Need to get above $6480 and close to have a shot at $6800. If the block at $6800 is broken and cleared this will confirm a higher low for now.

Member when I said to zoom out? 

If you were in a long and staring at the chart last night you could have been shaken out of your position.

We are right back above ~$8k support. I'm expecting a test of the 4hr range EQ.

Next major test is $8.8k, the EQ of the 3D range.

$BTC Here is my strategy for adding to my long. I've included an example of the last time I used this below.
- Bullish breaker entry from $6.4k low
- I am placing bids from the 62% retracement - 79% retracement (9.4k-9.3k)

$BTC here is how I entered long for this last move. 
- Higher TF directional bias was bullish
- Stop hunt into higher TF OB pairing smart money long orders with sell stops
- Mark 1HR OB looking for price to retrace and create a higher low
- Enter on confluent fib levels with OB

Bull scenario
- Price supported by the two green lines 
- A stop run below this consolidation into the pink zone is possible. If that happens it'll be fast 
- Close above black line @ $9.5k sets us up to take the liquidity above daily OB. $10k and up is a void and will fill fast

$BTC Bull vs Bear scenarios 
Last time we traded in a tight range like this $6.4k-$9.7k. I expect another big move once we close above or below this range. Bias is a killer, the best traders are nimble, be ready for either scenario.

Watching these patterns play out is a guilty pleasure of mine.
I'd bet both of these will get rekt.

Playing pattern breakouts is just asking to get rekt,
Either pick a side before they build or pick them up after they've played out.
And yes even if you wait for a retest.
